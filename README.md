## Small thank you and quick feedback from me :)

Firstly, I want to thank you for a chance in this recrutation :D I really love React and working with this technology is my dream so this recrutation really makes me happy even if I don't complete this asigment sucesfully.
Secendly, I want to get my feedback on my work and talk about how I done it :)

- I used Redux as my state controll managment tool
- I needed unfortunetly moment.js for operations on time becouse of the api which shipped time only with shift in seconds from UTC. Moment.js helped me a lot here with calculations.
- I didn't do tests becose of the lack of time it was really productive weekend and I didn't had a chance to use DDD here. I would use jest here and test redux logic precisely.

## How to open my project

1. Production mode:

- go to weather-app folder using console
- start app using "npm start" commend in console

2. Deployed project:

- to see deployed project go to https://remarkable-kulfi-d088cb.netlify.app/

# Thank you and see you soon :)

- Atmospheric pressure
- humidity

2. Historical (last 5 days) weather data presented on chart
3. Location search - input for typing location.
4. Selecting location:

- same as for current weather, but for selected location. It would be nice if there was historical chart too.

If you have an idea for other features, feel free to introduce them.
